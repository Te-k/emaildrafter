# emaildrafter

An app to let people draft personalised emails for a good cause.

Didn't want to spam the chat more so DM me for access!!

## Getting set up

We're using **pre-commit hooks** to maintain consistent code formatting

You need **Python 3.6** or later.

    python -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install wheel
    pip install -r requirements-dev-minimal.txt
    pre-commit install
