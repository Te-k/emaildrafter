<h3 style="color: white"> Inspiration </h3>
<p style="color: white">Inspired by the quick and widespread response of the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd on May 25th 2020, a group of students from 4 different UK Universities (Cambridge, Oxford, Southampton and York) came together and developed this web application to allow more people to show their displeasure to their representation in Parliament. 
We immediately found issues that the UK was complicit in: selling security gear to the unlawful US police, a lack of action over the death of Belly Mujinga, and a biased and colonised school curriculum. Weâ€™d like to see this change.
